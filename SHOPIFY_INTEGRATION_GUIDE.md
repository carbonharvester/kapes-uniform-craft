# Kapes Footer - Shopify Integration Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to integrate the converted Kapes footer into your Shopify theme. The footer has been converted from React/Tailwind to native Shopify Liquid with custom CSS.

## Files Created
- `sections/footer-kapes.liquid` - Main footer section template
- `assets/footer-kapes.css` - CSS styles for the footer

## Installation Steps

### 1. Upload Files to Your Shopify Theme

**Upload the Section:**
1. Go to your Shopify admin → Online Store → Themes
2. Click "Actions" → "Edit code" on your active theme
3. In the "Sections" folder, create a new file called `footer-kapes.liquid`

```
